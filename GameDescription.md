# Main Action

The main action of the game is to double jump.

# Hardest Part of Unreal

The hardest part about working in unreal is learning how the blueprints work together. Specifically, the blueprints relating to creating AI. I gave a few whacks at creating a basic roaming AI, but there were 3 or 4 that I just couldn't pin down. There's no codified tutorial on NPCs that I found, and putting them 
together always resulted in strange errors.

# Most interesting part of the game.

The fact that jumping creates an explosion noise.
